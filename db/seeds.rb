# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Coupon.create(coupon_code: 234, store: "hello")
Coupon.create(coupon_code: 233, store: "hells")
